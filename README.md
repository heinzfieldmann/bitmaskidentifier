# Identify configuration of tetrominos
Just a quick think about perceptrons

Train a network to regocnize tetris-shapes from scratch.

Why? To get a deeper understanding of neural networks.

How:
Python
numpy for the matris store

Todo:
Identify the network model.
Do some test of activiation functions.



The 5 tetromino shapes

**Straight:** vertical and horizontal reflection symmetry, and two-fold rotational symmetry
**Square:** vertical and horizontal reflection symmetry, and four-fold rotational symmetry
**T:** vertical reflection symmetry only
**L:** no symmetry
**S:** two-fold rotational symmetry only
